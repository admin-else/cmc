# CMC the Minecraft Protcol in C

## Why?

Minecraft is a complex game with a complex networking but sadly not many people make it accsesible to everyone.
There is one project i really REALLY like and are inspred by [MineflayerJS](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/).
I want to make something like they did but more portable.

## Goals

I want this libary to simply haha be a thing that takes minecraft packets and makes them readable, nothing more nothing less no networking or or oter things.
