# CMC the Minecraft Protcol in C

## Why?

Minecraft is a complex game with a complex networking but sadly not many people make it accsesible to everyone.
There is one project i really REALLY like and are inspred by (MineflayerJS)[https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/].
I want to make something like they did but more portable.
